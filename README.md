# dotfiles

My UN*X dotfiles and other configuration files.

Feel free to peruse these, and even to use them as a start for your own use. I have stood on the shoulders of giants (and, besides, it's turtles all the way down).

Each the files in this repo have been added because I want to
1. have easy access for deployment on new UN*X machines I wind up working on, including my go-to platform, macOS [Darwin].
2. share with others those things over the years I've found useful, productive, and fun.

What you read here is not a complete list, but rather some highlights targeted to new command-line users.

| filename        | purpose |
| ------------- |------------- |
| .bash_profile   | Primary workhorse for customizing your bash experience. My `.bashrc_profile` includes a test yoke, which you can switch on to validate the internal functions I've written. I'm a quality assurance software engineer, and I'm really proud of giving this file the full software reliability treatment. |
| .gitconfig | `git` configuration |
| .gitignore | Local additions for things `git` should ignore, extending `.gitignore_global`. |
| .gitignore_global	| A master `.gitignore` based upon the collected wisdom we call <https://www.gitignore.io>. |
| .grc/ | Radovan Garab√≠k's [Generic Colouriser ](http://kassiopeia.juls.savba.sk/~garabik/software/grc.html) is an almost-trivial way to colorise text output from any program. Makes everything easier. |
| .inputrc     | Changes input processing for all programs that use readline (like bash, python, etc) and turbo-charges what you can do with fingers still on the keyboard |
| .macos | Mathias Bynens' jaw-dropping _magnum opus_ of `default write` commands that tweak every aspect of macOS (found in his own [dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos) repo. |
| .set_colors.sh | Provide color shortcuts for shell prompts, etc. |
| .set_prompt.sh | Create an easy-to-love command shell prompt. |
| .vimrc | Configure the `vim` text editor to be borderline awesome. |
| bin | My home-grown binaries (programs)
| README.md	| This very file. |
